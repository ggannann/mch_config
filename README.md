ESS MTCA NAT MCH Configuration
======

**This module is under development.**

MCH Configuration is one of teadious and combersome procedures. This repository
may help users to configure their NAT MCH with minimum efforts. With tftp, 
expect, and shell scripts, ICS at ESS would like to develop an automation tool
to configure the NAT MCH massively. 

Currently, we are in the stage to find the optimal solution and the standard
configuration options of MCH per a ESS Standard 3U and 9U MTCA System 
Configuration. This repository can hold almost all resouces for NAT MCH
configuration. 

## Requirements

* A Linux (TFTP service, expect, bash)
* Configuration of TFTP according to the directory structure
* MOXA Serial Server
* In-house Serial Cable between MCH and MOXA
